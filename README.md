dots
====

My dot and config files and scripts to install them. The main `./setup.sh` script will install all
of the modules in this repo; however, each module can also be installed individually.

### Set up on any machine

#### Bootstrap script

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akofink/dots/main/bootstrap.sh && source bootstrap.sh
```

##### Regenerating the bootstrap script

```sh
./create_bootstrap.sh
```

#### From the cloned repo

##### Set up all modules

```sh
./setup.sh
```

##### Set up just one module:

```sh
source setup/<module>.sh

The top-level `setup.sh` orchestrates a curated subset of modulesâ€”currently `vim`, `tmux`, `zsh`,
`rbenv`, and `tmuxinator`. Feel free to tailor that list or run any other module script directly.
```

### Contributing

Fork this repo, and add your own templates. Pull requests for updates to setup scripts are welcome!

#### Local development and Testing

A Makefile is provided with some commands for testing across various Linux distros:

``` 
make docker-build # build all three Linux variants

# Run the top level setup.sh in a new container, and drop the user into a shell afterwards:
make docker-run-alpine
make docker-run-debian
make docker-run-fedora

# Lint all shell scripts with ShellCheck
make check
```

The `make check` target requires [`shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net/) to be installed in your
environment. It runs ShellCheck with `--severity=warning` so you see actionable warnings and errors
without the noisier informational suggestions.

#### pre-commit hooks

This repository ships with a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) configuration that runs ShellCheck
before each commit. Enable it locally with:

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# Optional: run every hook against the whole repository
pre-commit run --all-files
```
