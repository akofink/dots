Thoughts on Schumann Fantasy
============================

Movement 1
----------

* Intro
  * First appearence of a theme
  * Second part of the first theme introduces another theme
* Second part
* Almost fades to nothingness and then part 3 (c# to d)
  * Slower, more delicate, and then...(part 4)
* Part 4 - big surprise (intro)
  * back to a previous theme here
* Back to the original theme but with more fanfare
* Broken by a trill and a *scale* down to a low note
* Part 5 - a new theme?
  * slower, and them methodical
  * building with excitement
  * and then a calm pause for a delicate theme
  * building back up to Part 6
* Part 6 - heard this before
  * now with more movement
  * slowly dies to part 7
* Part 7 - Big, fast
  * slows down to transition back to part 6 (?) theme
  * and then a cadenza-like section signaling we're near the end
* Part 8 - a new melody
  * delicate, trickling down to the end...but wait!
* Part 9 - back to a previous theme (summary of all previous parts?)
  * with fanfare
  * and another more delicate yet quick previously heard theme
  * and a build-up we have already heard before as well
  * a different theme is heard again
  * and then to a new little transition (higher b)
  * and back to part 4's surprise
  * winding down here with another common melody
  * now with a bit more of a twist, repeated a few times
  * to the end of the movement, slowing and softening
