Thoughts on Schumann Fantasy
============================

Movement 1
----------

* Intro
  * First appearence of a theme
  * Second part of the first theme introduces another theme
* Second part
* Almost fades to nothingness and then part 3 (c# to d)
  * Slower, more delicate, and then...(part 4)
* Part 4 - big surprise (intro)
  * back to a previous theme here
* Back to the original theme but with more fanfare
* Broken by a trill and a *scale* down to a low note
* Part 5 - a new theme?
  * slower, and them methodical
  * building with excitement
  * and then a calm pause for a delicate theme
  * building back up to Part 6
* Part 6 - heard this before
  * now with more movement
  * slowly dies to part 7
* Part 7 - Big, fast
  * slows down to transition back to part 6 (?) theme
  * and then a cadenza-like section signaling we're near the end
* Part 8 - a new melody
  * delicate, trickling down to the end...but wait!
* Part 9 - back to a previous theme (summary of all previous parts?)
  * with fanfare
  * and another more delicate yet quick previously heard theme
  * and a build-up we have already heard before as well
  * a different theme is heard again
  * and then to a new little transition (higher b)
  * and back to part 4's surprise
  * winding down here with another common melody
  * now with a bit more of a twist, repeated a few times
  * to the end of the movement, slowing and softening

Movement 2
----------

* Part 1
  * Flourish entrance
  * March-like melody
* Part 2
  * More delicate
  * Build up to a... soft part
  * building, building
* A new melody arrives (maybe Part 3)
  * now back to the original theme
  * trill, break, and back to the melody
  * and again with the trill
  * all sounds similar in this part
* Part 4 - Big Russian sound
  * now more delicate but flowing, methodical
  * brief pause and transition
* Part 5
  * New theme, slower, more delicate
  * Same theme, higher
  * With passion, dying out, then surprise up high
  * to a small transition
  * Another variation on the same theme
  * A different theme? that we have heard before
  * trill, break, and back to the melody a couple of times
  * Repeated from part 3
  * Back to original melody from mvt 1? or maybe earlier in mvt 2
  * building up to a faster part
* Part 6
  * high, fast
  * louder here, repeated to the end with fanfare

Movement 3
----------

* Part 1
  * C major arpeggios
  * building and dying
  * building again and dying
  * A different melody introduced with flowing motion
  * Dying to more arpeggios
  * and building again and dying
* Part 2
  * A new theme for a bit
  * and the theme continues after a brief pause
  * Same theme in a minor key?
  * and now back to major
  * now it's in the left hand
  * and accompanied with the right hand
  * building and then dying back
  * and building again and dying
  * and now high repeated notes
  * building up
  * Another theme we've heard before
  * Transition with high notes falling down
  * End with a 7-1 transition back to arpeggios
  * and the original theme interspersed with more arpeggios
  * building up just like the end of part 1
  * the theme switches ranges and complexity
  * short transition back to theme 2
  * Excited arpeggios slowing down with intensity to the end
