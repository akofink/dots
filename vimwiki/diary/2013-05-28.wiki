Dear Diary,

= This is my first entry! =

== User Authentication ==
* If an admin logs out, a non-admin should not have access to admin pages
* authenticate should return true or false
* The app should not tell the user that he/she has logged in unless he/she has just logged in.

== Learned Today ==
* In a controller, use `respond_to` to add JSON or HTML as a response
* Fat arrow (`=>`) assigns `this` to the inner scope of a lambda method (as opposed to stabby (`->`)
* Always use parenthesis in coffeescript for calling functions!
* Treat javascript as a functional language: pass state instead of using instance variables
