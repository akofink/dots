= Meeting with Mason, Jackson, and Tyler =
* Merging two apps
* First two apps built for Bayer
* Point of both projects is to find good genes for selective breeding
  * Corn and Soybeans
  * Find genes from bacteria
  * Good things
    * Pest resistance
    * Drought resistance
    * Pesticide/Herbicide Resistance
      * Roundup resistant
  * Find - 'Localized Search'
    * Strain
      * 1. Getting genes/material from bacteria
      * 2. See if it does 'good things'
      * n. (Fractionation) Test again to make sure
    * MiDAS
      * 3. Extract the gene sequences
      * 4. Compare genes with patented genes

== Why to merge them ==
* Shared Authentication
* Shared reporting
* Shared database
* simpler upgrades
* same UI/design
  * Shared CSS/js
* Infrastructure Outages
  * Causes failures if one app is out but the other is not
  * May lead to omissions/mistakes
* Performance of two parallel apps
* Test servers

== Why not to merge them ==

== Strain/Bioassay ==
* 6 years old
* None/password protected pages

== MiDAS ==
* 4 years old
* 3 role authentication
