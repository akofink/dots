=== SQL Optimizations ===
* _Lazy Loading_ Use `join` and `where` to minimize SQL queries and to minimize data use
* Make sure to place an index on all the foreign keys in the database
* Write as few queries as possible

=== Other Optimizations ===
* Use a hash where appropriate instead of arrays
* Don't use too much memory
